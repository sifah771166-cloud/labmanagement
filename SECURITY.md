## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. **Change Default Passwords**
   - Never use default admin/user passwords in production
   - Use strong, unique passwords

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` file to version control
   - Use strong JWT_SECRET in production
   - Keep sensitive data in environment variables

3. **HTTPS**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Use valid SSL certificates

4. **Database**
   - Regular backups
   - Restrict database access
   - Use proper file permissions

5. **Server**
   - Keep Node.js and dependencies updated
   - Use firewall to restrict access
   - Monitor logs for suspicious activity

6. **Updates**
   - Regularly update dependencies: `npm audit fix`
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Apply security patches promptly

### Known Security Considerations

1. **Password Hashing**: Currently using SHA-256. Consider upgrading to bcrypt for production.
2. **Token Storage**: Tokens stored in localStorage. Consider using httpOnly cookies for enhanced security.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented. Consider adding rate limiting for production.
4. **CSRF Protection**: Not implemented. Consider adding CSRF tokens for production.
